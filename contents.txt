[<p>We’re a leading research university with a heart. Founded in the decade that the U.S. Constitution was signed, we’re the nation’s oldest Catholic and Jesuit university.

Meet the people and places that make Georgetown home.</p>, <p>“Georgetown is home to me not because of the fancy buildings like Healy Hall, or its prestigious reputation, but rather because of the university’s care for the whole person as each of us attempts to live our lives for others.” </p>, <p>Our holistic approach to education, the rigorous spirit of inquiry that makes our community and alumni a force for change in the world, our commitment to social justice – all underly everything we do as an institution with a rich Catholic and Jesuit heritage.</p>, <p>You’ll come to Georgetown to deepen your passions and beliefs, and you’ll leave as the person you were always meant to be. Your heart and mind will open as you connect with a community that shares a commitment to social justice and the common good.</p>, <p>“It’s likely that you will come to love some of the most amazing souls this campus has to offer. That love may come in the form of friendships that you know will last forever. Or maybe it will find its way to your heart through mentors who will offer guidance and perspectives that could change your worldview entirely.” – Jerome</p>, <p>“Research is detective work and that is what truly appealed to me…  I try to focus on what gets me excited, and that is really appealing to students’ imaginations and framing it in the context of discovery.” – Professor Chandan Vaidya</p>, <p>“I was fortunate enough to have a couple of ambassadors and former ambassadors as professors, [and that] opened a whole new universe to me of opportunity. So, my time at the School of Foreign Service was really formative, and I am glad I can lean on it in some respects as ambassador.” – Alaina</p>, <p></p>, <p>Georgetown University<br/>

[<p>Shaped by centuries of Jesuit education around the globe, our culture embraces the changing times while staying true to core values – engaging your intellect, helping you grow ethically and spiritually, exchanging ideas freely and building a more just world.</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the ways that we embody our Jesuit heritage is by making a home for all faith traditions.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Whether you’re religious, nonreligious or searching for a spiritual home, we accompany you on your journey </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and help you lead a life of deeper meaning, belonging and purpose.</span></p>, <p>Students often ask about the theology component at Georgetown and what it means to attend a Jesuit university.

John Carroll’s founding of Georgetown College coincides with the birth of our nation.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img alt="Students play sports on the front lawn of historic campus." class="wp-image-6030 size-large aligncenter" height="765" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" src="https://www.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/gu_archives_sports_00026-1024x765.jpg" srcset="https://www.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/gu_archives_sports_00026-1024x765.jpg 1024w, https://www.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/gu_archives_sports_00026-300x224.jpg 300w, https://www.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/gu_archives_sports_00026-768x574.jpg 768w, https://www.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/gu_archives_sports_00026.jpg 1200w" width="1024"/></span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 1789, Carroll secured the deed to 60 acres of land on a hilltop overlooking the village of Georgetown. He was appointed Archbishop of Baltimore in 1808.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Classes began in 1792. Within the first year, attendance grew to more than 40 students – some as far away as the West Indies. In 1817, the school awarded its first two bachelor’s degrees.</span></p>, <p><img alt="Soldiers look across the Potomac River" class="wp-image-7174 size-large aligncenter" height="796" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" src="https://www.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IM000199_2-1024x796.jpg" srcset="https://www.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IM000199_2-1024x796.jpg 1024w, https://www.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IM000199_2-300x233.jpg 300w, https://www.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IM000199_2-768x597.jpg 768w, https://www.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IM000199_2.jpg 1423w" width="1024"/></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Civil War (1861-1865) nearly closed Georgetown, as the student body dropped from 313 to 17 between 1859 and 1861. A total of 1,141 students and alumni enlisted in the war, serving in both the Union and Confederate forces.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the Second Battle of Bull Run in Manassas, Virginia, in 1862, several campus buildings were turned into a temporary hospital. To celebrate the end of the Civil War, Georgetown students selected the colors blue (Union) and gray (Confederate) as the school’s official colors in 1876.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img alt="A historic photo of the Med-Dent building." class="wp-image-6037 size-large aligncenter" height="769" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" src="https://www.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/gu_archives_campus_00076-1024x769.jpg" srcset="https://www.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/gu_archives_campus_00076-1024x769.jpg 1024w, https://www.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/gu_archives_campus_00076-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/gu_archives_campus_00076-768x577.jpg 768w, https://www.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/gu_archives_campus_00076.jpg 1200w" width="1024"/></span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Georgetown established the School of Medicine in 1851 and the Law School in 1870. Patrick F. Healy, S.J., the university’s president between 1873 and 1882, was the first African American to earn a Ph.D. and the first to head a major U.S. university. Healy dramatically reformed the university’s curriculum with a new emphasis on history and the natural sciences and started construction on the Flemish Romanesque-style Healy Hall in 1877.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joseph Havens Richards, S.J., president from 1888 to 1898, established graduate courses in the arts and sciences and built new facilities for the law and medical schools. The university’s expansion continued into the 20th century, with the opening of the School of Dentistry in 1901, School of Nursing in 1903 and the School of Foreign Service in 1919 under the direction of Edmund Walsh, S.J. The School of Dentistry closed in 1990.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img alt="" class="size-large wp-image-7200 aligncenter" height="737" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" src="https://www.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IM000324-1024x737.jpg" srcset="https://www.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IM000324.jpg 1024w, https://www.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IM000324-300x216.jpg 300w, https://www.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IM000324-768x553.jpg 768w" width="1024"/></span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the new decade of post-war peace and prosperity took off in the early 1920s, Georgetown mirrored the nation’s period of growth prompting the construction of New North, Copley Hall, White-Gravenor Building and the Medical and Dental Building. By 1930, enrollment had nearly doubled, reaching 2,600.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Great Depression was a period of great consolidation for Georgetown as enrollment fell below 2,000. Despite a time of economic hardship, President Arthur O’Leary, S.J., formally organized the Graduate School in the 1930s, offering programs in mathematics, the natural sciences, economics, history and government.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During World War II, the U.S. War Department designated Georgetown as one of a select number of universities to house the Army Specialized Training Program. More than 75 percent of students enrolled in the 1943-44 academic year were military servicemen. During the 1944-45 academic year, women were allowed to enroll in the School of Foreign Service.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img alt="" class="size-large wp-image-7197 aligncenter" height="820" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" src="https://www.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/gu_archives_campus_00134-1024x820.jpg" srcset="https://www.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/gu_archives_campus_00134-1024x820.jpg 1024w, https://www.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/gu_archives_campus_00134-300x240.jpg 300w, https://www.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/gu_archives_campus_00134-768x615.jpg 768w, https://www.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/gu_archives_campus_00134.jpg 1194w" width="1024"/></span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The years after World War II saw another increase in enrollment and expansion of the university. Under the leadership of Edward Bunn, S.J. (1952-1964), Georgetown created the School of Business Administration in 1957, an outgrowth of the School of Foreign Service. Bunn is also responsible for creating the School for Summer and Continuing Education, now the School for Continuing Studies, in the 1950s.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Across the nation, the 1960s were shaped by the emergence of revolutionary ideas and social upheaval. Georgetown students were on campus when the assassinations of President John F. Kennedy, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy took place. The women’s movement began to take hold, and women were accepted into the College for the first time in 1969. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Students demonstrated against the Vietnam War in the 1970s, causing some disruptions to classes and campus life. By the end of the decade, most of the anger and discontent had been redirected into positive social action. Students started an annual tradition of spending their spring break helping underprivileged communities outside of Washington, DC, a program that Georgetown students continue to take part in.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img alt="Ronald Reagan gives an address at Georgetown." class="wp-image-6049 size-large aligncenter" height="681" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" src="https://www.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/gu_archives_us_presidents_00015-1024x681.jpg" srcset="https://www.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/gu_archives_us_presidents_00015-1024x681.jpg 1024w, https://www.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/gu_archives_us_presidents_00015-300x199.jpg 300w, https://www.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/gu_archives_us_presidents_00015-768x511.jpg 768w" width="1024"/></span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 1980s were a time of tremendous growth on campus with the completion of Yates Field House and the opening of the Bunn Intercultural Center, new residence halls and the $51 million Thomas and Dorothy Leavey Center for students. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the university’s bicentennial year (1988-89), U.S. President Ronald Reagan provided the opening address to kick off the yearlong celebration, the culmination of which included a reunion ball with over 3,500 guests at DC’s Union Station. The 1980s also began a “golden age” in two traditional sports at Georgetown – basketball and track. Under coaches John Thompson Jr. and Frank Gagliano, basketball and track enjoyed unprecedented periods of success from the early 1980s well into the 1990s.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img alt="" class="size-large wp-image-7203 aligncenter" height="737" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" src="https://www.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/19750805-Walsh-Globe_0001-1024x737.jpg" srcset="https://www.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/19750805-Walsh-Globe_0001.jpg 1024w, https://www.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/19750805-Walsh-Globe_0001-300x216.jpg 300w, https://www.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/19750805-Walsh-Globe_0001-768x553.jpg 768w" width="1024"/></span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the leadership of Rev. Timothy Healy, S.J., (1976-1989) and Rev. Leo O’Donovan, S.J.,(1989-2001) Georgetown saw significant increases in the diversity of its students and faculty, and the number of faculty positions as it grew from a regional school to one of national prominence. Women also greatly increased their numbers within the faculty during the 1990s – making up nearly 40 percent by 2001. O’Donovan also oversaw the restructuring of the Medical Center and the separation of the hospital from the medical school. In 2001, John J.

Georgetown uses its own application for admission and we are able to coordinate an alumni interview for nearly all candidates. While a candidate’s academic performance is the most important criteria under consideration, accomplishments outside of the classroom, demonstrated commitment to the broader community, and personal qualities such as resiliency, motivation and ambition are certainly considered. It is these qualities that make you an individual and someone who will uniquely add to – and benefit from – the Georgetown University community. We look forward to getting to know you.</p>, <p>To experience the university’s rich environment, we invite you to campus to attend an information session and campus tour.  Reservations are required so please see <a href="/visiting">Visit Georgetown</a> page for more information.  Throughout the year we host information sessions presented by a member of the admissions staff followed by student-led campus tours.

The university enrolls more than 6,300 undergraduates from all 50 states and over 130 countries; approximately a third of all students are fluent in more than one language when they arrive on campus. Whether you hail from a small, rural community or a major metropolitan area – or somewhere in between – you will find a place among Georgetown’s dynamic and talented community of students.</p>, <p>Georgetown’s commitment to ensuring a diverse student body is evidenced through its need-blind admission process and its commitment to meet 100% of the demonstrated financial need for all eligible students. Every undergraduate applicant receives admission consideration without regard to his or her financial circumstances. Once admitted, every student will have his or her demonstrated financial need met in full.

[<p>We’re a leading research university with a heart. Founded in the decade that the U.S. Constitution was signed, we’re the nation’s oldest Catholic and Jesuit university. Today we’re a forward-looking, diverse community devoted to social justice, restless inquiry and respect for each person’s individual needs and talents.</p>, <p>We’re a community of people who bridge our disparate experiences and identities. Meet the people and places that make Georgetown home.</p>, <p>“Georgetown is home to me not because of the fancy buildings like Healy Hall, or its prestigious reputation, but rather because of the university’s care for the whole person as each of us attempts to live our lives for others.” </p>, <p>Our holistic approach to education, the rigorous spirit of inquiry that makes our community and alumni a force for change in the world, our commitment to social justice – all underly everything we do as an institution with a rich Catholic and Jesuit heritage.</p>, <p>You’ll come to Georgetown to deepen your passions and beliefs, and you’ll leave as the person you were always meant to be. Your heart and mind will open as you connect with a community that shares a commitment to social justice and the common good.</p>, <p>“It’s likely that you will come to love some of the most amazing souls this campus has to offer. That love may come in the form of friendships that you know will last forever. Or maybe it will find its way to your heart through mentors who will offer guidance and perspectives that could change your worldview entirely.” – Jerome</p>, <p>“Research is detective work and that is what truly appealed to me…  I try to focus on what gets me excited, and that is really appealing to students’ imaginations and framing it in the context of discovery.” – Professor Chandan Vaidya</p>, <p>“I was fortunate enough to have a couple of ambassadors and former ambassadors as professors, [and that] opened a whole new universe to me of opportunity. So, my time at the School of Foreign Service was really formative, and I am glad I can lean on it in some respects as ambassador.” – Alaina</p>, <p></p>, <p>Georgetown University<br/>

</p>, <p>Join a first-year or transfer ESCAPE to retreat from the Hilltop. Located in the Shenandoah Valley, you’ll get the chance to meet new people, enjoy live music, reflect on your experience and take a step back from the frenzy of campus life.</p>, <p>“If I hadn’t come to Georgetown, I probably never would have taken a theology class … here I am, probably going to declare a minor in theology any day now!”</p>, <p>“While the competitive environment pressures you into being your best … the school always reminds you that life is more than that.”</p>, <p>“We are beholden to our commitments to caring for the whole person and developing people for others. I believe these should be at the core of how we approach our pedagogy, work with students and function as an institution.”</p>, <p>Extend your classroom discussions with like-minded friends and deepen your social, intellectual or spiritual growth by joining one of our campus Living Learning Communities. Explore justice and diversity, Spanish immersion, entrepreneurship and more. </p>, <p>As a part of Georgetown’s theology core requirement, tens of thousands of students have taken the iconic Problem of God course, where students of different faith backgrounds explore the possibilities of and challenges to religious belief in a contemporary context.</p>, <p>“Part of a liberal arts education is to get into the basement and address fundamental human questions, and there’s no more direct way to do that than taking up the question of God and the possibility of religious experience.” -Rev.

[<p>Shaped by centuries of Jesuit education around the globe, our culture embraces the changing times while staying true to core values – engaging your intellect, helping you grow ethically and spiritually, exchanging ideas freely and building a more just world.</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the ways that we embody our Jesuit heritage is by making a home for all faith traditions.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Whether you’re religious, nonreligious or searching for a spiritual home, we accompany you on your journey </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and help you lead a life of deeper meaning, belonging and purpose.</span></p>, <p>Students often ask about the theology component at Georgetown and what it means to attend a Jesuit university.

He was appointed Archbishop of Baltimore in 1808.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Classes began in 1792. Within the first year, attendance grew to more than 40 students – some as far away as the West Indies.

Patrick F. Healy, S.J., the university’s president between 1873 and 1882, was the first African American to earn a Ph.D. and the first to head a major U.S. university. Healy dramatically reformed the university’s curriculum with a new emphasis on history and the natural sciences and started construction on the Flemish Romanesque-style Healy Hall in 1877.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joseph Havens Richards, S.J., president from 1888 to 1898, established graduate courses in the arts and sciences and built new facilities for the law and medical schools. The university’s expansion continued into the 20th century, with the opening of the School of Dentistry in 1901, School of Nursing in 1903 and the School of Foreign Service in 1919 under the direction of Edmund Walsh, S.J. The School of Dentistry closed in 1990.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img alt="" class="size-large wp-image-7200 aligncenter" height="737" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" src="https://www.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IM000324-1024x737.jpg" srcset="https://www.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IM000324.jpg 1024w, https://www.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IM000324-300x216.jpg 300w, https://www.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IM000324-768x553.jpg 768w" width="1024"/></span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the new decade of post-war peace and prosperity took off in the early 1920s, Georgetown mirrored the nation’s period of growth prompting the construction of New North, Copley Hall, White-Gravenor Building and the Medical and Dental Building. By 1930, enrollment had nearly doubled, reaching 2,600.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Great Depression was a period of great consolidation for Georgetown as enrollment fell below 2,000. Despite a time of economic hardship, President Arthur O’Leary, S.J., formally organized the Graduate School in the 1930s, offering programs in mathematics, the natural sciences, economics, history and government.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During World War II, the U.S. War Department designated Georgetown as one of a select number of universities to house the Army Specialized Training Program. More than 75 percent of students enrolled in the 1943-44 academic year were military servicemen. During the 1944-45 academic year, women were allowed to enroll in the School of Foreign Service.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img alt="" class="size-large wp-image-7197 aligncenter" height="820" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" src="https://www.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/gu_archives_campus_00134-1024x820.jpg" srcset="https://www.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/gu_archives_campus_00134-1024x820.jpg 1024w, https://www.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/gu_archives_campus_00134-300x240.jpg 300w, https://www.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/gu_archives_campus_00134-768x615.jpg 768w, https://www.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/gu_archives_campus_00134.jpg 1194w" width="1024"/></span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The years after World War II saw another increase in enrollment and expansion of the university. Under the leadership of Edward Bunn, S.J. (1952-1964), Georgetown created the School of Business Administration in 1957, an outgrowth of the School of Foreign Service. Bunn is also responsible for creating the School for Summer and Continuing Education, now the School for Continuing Studies, in the 1950s.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Across the nation, the 1960s were shaped by the emergence of revolutionary ideas and social upheaval. Georgetown students were on campus when the assassinations of President John F. Kennedy, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy took place. The women’s movement began to take hold, and women were accepted into the College for the first time in 1969. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Students demonstrated against the Vietnam War in the 1970s, causing some disruptions to classes and campus life. By the end of the decade, most of the anger and discontent had been redirected into positive social action. Students started an annual tradition of spending their spring break helping underprivileged communities outside of Washington, DC, a program that Georgetown students continue to take part in.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img alt="Ronald Reagan gives an address at Georgetown." class="wp-image-6049 size-large aligncenter" height="681" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" src="https://www.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/gu_archives_us_presidents_00015-1024x681.jpg" srcset="https://www.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/gu_archives_us_presidents_00015-1024x681.jpg 1024w, https://www.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/gu_archives_us_presidents_00015-300x199.jpg 300w, https://www.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/gu_archives_us_presidents_00015-768x511.jpg 768w" width="1024"/></span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 1980s were a time of tremendous growth on campus with the completion of Yates Field House and the opening of the Bunn Intercultural Center, new residence halls and the $51 million Thomas and Dorothy Leavey Center for students. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the university’s bicentennial year (1988-89), U.S. President Ronald Reagan provided the opening address to kick off the yearlong celebration, the culmination of which included a reunion ball with over 3,500 guests at DC’s Union Station. The 1980s also began a “golden age” in two traditional sports at Georgetown – basketball and track. Under coaches John Thompson Jr. and Frank Gagliano, basketball and track enjoyed unprecedented periods of success from the early 1980s well into the 1990s.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img alt="" class="size-large wp-image-7203 aligncenter" height="737" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" src="https://www.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/19750805-Walsh-Globe_0001-1024x737.jpg" srcset="https://www.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/19750805-Walsh-Globe_0001.jpg 1024w, https://www.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/19750805-Walsh-Globe_0001-300x216.jpg 300w, https://www.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/19750805-Walsh-Globe_0001-768x553.jpg 768w" width="1024"/></span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the leadership of Rev. Timothy Healy, S.J., (1976-1989) and Rev. Leo O’Donovan, S.J.,(1989-2001) Georgetown saw significant increases in the diversity of its students and faculty, and the number of faculty positions as it grew from a regional school to one of national prominence. Women also greatly increased their numbers within the faculty during the 1990s – making up nearly 40 percent by 2001. O’Donovan also oversaw the restructuring of the Medical Center and the separation of the hospital from the medical school. In 2001, John J.

[<p>Georgetown University, with its tradition of Jesuit education, a location in Washington, DC, and a distinguished community of scholars from around the world, is a vibrant place to live and learn. We are pleased you have chosen to learn more about the opportunities for undergraduate students that await you here at Georgetown. To ensure that you receive timely communication from our office, invitations to Georgetown events in your hometown area, we welcome you to join our <a href="https://uapply.georgetown.edu/register/joinmailinglist">mailing list.</a></p>, <p>We believe you will find Georgetown’s application process highly personalized. Georgetown uses its own application for admission and we are able to coordinate an alumni interview for nearly all candidates. While a candidate’s academic performance is the most important criteria under consideration, accomplishments outside of the classroom, demonstrated commitment to the broader community, and personal qualities such as resiliency, motivation and ambition are certainly considered. It is these qualities that make you an individual and someone who will uniquely add to – and benefit from – the Georgetown University community. We look forward to getting to know you.</p>, <p>To experience the university’s rich environment, we invite you to campus to attend an information session and campus tour.  Reservations are required so please see <a href="/visiting">Visit Georgetown</a> page for more information.  Throughout the year we host information sessions presented by a member of the admissions staff followed by student-led campus tours. The Georgetown admissions staff also travels throughout the United States and internationally during the spring and fall.</p>, <p>Georgetown actively seeks and recruits highly talented and motivated students from all backgrounds. The university enrolls more than 6,300 undergraduates from all 50 states and over 130 countries; approximately a third of all students are fluent in more than one language when they arrive on campus. Whether you hail from a small, rural community or a major metropolitan area – or somewhere in between – you will find a place among Georgetown’s dynamic and talented community of students.</p>, <p>Georgetown’s commitment to ensuring a diverse student body is evidenced through its need-blind admission process and its commitment to meet 100% of the demonstrated financial need for all eligible students. Every undergraduate applicant receives admission consideration without regard to his or her financial circumstances. Once admitted, every student will have his or her demonstrated financial need met in full.

</p>, <p>Philosophy professor <a href="https://kennedyinstitute.georgetown.edu/people/quill-r-kukla/">Quill Kukla</a>, a senior research scholar at the university’s<a href="https://kennedyinstitute.georgetown.edu/"> Kennedy Institute of Ethics (KIE)</a>, is one of only 100 applicants around the world to receive the highly coveted <a href="https://www.humboldt-foundation.de/web/humboldt-award.html">Humboldt Research Award</a>. </p>, <p>The award is given to scholars whose work has had a significant impact in their field and spotlights those expected to continue their innovative research throughout their career.  </p>, <p>The Humboldt Foundation award was created for scholars from all disciplines and nationalities to work in Germany for up to one year, collaborating on long-term research projects alongside colleagues at an academic institution. </p>, <p>“I’m extraordinarily honored to receive this award,” says Kukla, who serves as the editor-in-chief of the <em>Kennedy Institute of Ethics Journal</em>. “I already have wonderful, exciting connections to colleagues in Berlin and Hannover, and much of my own research recently has focused on the city of Berlin itself, so this will be a fantastic opportunity to further my own research, collaborate, and build connections.”</p>, <p>Kukla says they will focus on geographic knowledge and the representation of spatial information. </p>, <p>“I also have important side projects that I will be pursuing – one on socially charged public speech and one on street art and its role in placemaking, territory and place identity,” says the professor, a core faculty member of Georgetown’s Disability Studies program.</p>, <p>Kukla, who describes their work as “quirky and off the beaten path,” says receiving an award that is typically reserved for more traditional research is exceptional.</p>, <p>They were nominated for the award by Mathias Frisch, a physicist and professor of philosophy at Leibniz University because of the Georgetown professor’s published work on the role of values and interests in scientific methodology and in shaping scientific concepts, particularly in medicine.</p>, <p>Kukla has written on public health ethics, the ethics of health communication, research ethics, methodological issues in medical research and the social epistemology of medicine.</p>, <p>While in Germany, Kukla will work with Frisch and other philosophers of science. </p>, <p>They say these academics are “deeply interested in the role that social interests play in shaping scientific methodology, research programs and the communication of scientific knowledge.”</p>, <p>Before coming to Georgetown, Kukla served as co-coordinator for the Feminist Approaches to Bioethics Network and from 2003-2005 was a Greenwall Fellow in Bioethics and Health Policy at Johns Hopkins University. </p>, <p>They also will help create a collaborative network among philosophers at Leibniz University Hannover and at the Technical University of Berlin.  </p>, <p>“The Kennedy Institute and the philosophy department are immensely proud of Quill’s work and are pleased to see them given the international recognition this prize implies,” says<a href="https://kennedyinstitute.georgetown.edu/people/daniel-sulmasy/"> Daniel Sulmasy</a>, KIE’s acting director. “They clearly deserve this award and we look forward to reading the results of their ongoing work in philosophy.”<br/></p>, <p itemprop="department">Georgetown College</p>, <p itemprop="streetAddress">37th and O Streets, N.W.</p>, <p>

[<p>In keeping with state and federal legislation, the University safeguards the privacy of patients, students, employees, University business, and other matters by protecting electronic records classified as confidential information. Unauthorized accessing and/or disclosure of confidential information by University employees is prohibited and may result in legal penalties. This policy applies to records maintained in any type of electronic record: computer, voice, or video. It also applies to records created via the Georgetown University website.</p>, <p><strong>Electronic Records:</strong> Electronic transmissions or messages created, sent, forwarded, replied to, transmitted, distributed, broadcast, stored, held, copied, downloaded, displayed, viewed, read, or printed by one or several electronic systems or services. This definition of electronic records applies equally to the contents of such records, attachments to such records, and transactional information associated with such records.</p>, <p><strong>University Administrative Record:</strong> A University Record (see definition below) that is directly related to the conduct of the University’s administrative business.</p>, <p><strong>University Record:</strong> By law, University records are any papers, books, photographs, tapes, films, recordings, or other documentary materials, or any copies thereof, regardless of physical form or characteristics, made, produced, executed, or received by any department or office of the University or by any academic or administrative staff member in connection with the transaction of University business, and retained by that agency or its successor as evidence of its activities or functions because of the information contained therein.</p>, <p><strong>University Electronic Record:</strong> A University Record in the form of an electronic record, whether or not any of the electronic communications resources utilized to create, send, forward, reply to, transmit, store, hold, copy, download, display, view, read, or print the electronic communications record are owned by the University. This implies that the location of the record, or the location of its creation or use, does not change its nature as a University electronic record for purposes of this or other University policy.</p>, <p>Until determined otherwise or unless it is clear from the context, any electronic record residing on university-owned or controlled telecommunications, video, audio, and computing facilities will be deemed to be a University electronic record for purposes of this Policy.</p>, <p><strong>Notification</strong> Users should be notified that information is being collected and they should be informed of their rights. (e.g., all Web pages that collect personally identifiable information should include a privacy notice that specifies how the information will be used.)</p>, <p><strong>Minimization</strong> The institution should gather as little information as possible for legitimate purposes and delete information when it is no longer needed or no longer required by law to be retained. (e.g., library records need not be kept for more than a certain limited period of time.)</p>, <p><strong>Secondary</strong> Use Information should be used only for the purposes for which it was collected unless the individual gives additional consent. (e.g., a department should not share information with an administrative office for a separate purpose without the individual’s knowledge and consent.)</p>, <p><strong>Nondisclosure and Consent</strong> Information should not be released to third parties external to the University without consent. (e.g., vendors, business, etc.)</p>, <p><strong>Need to Know</strong> Only those with legitimate, official needs should have access to information. (e.g., a person’s position of authority in the University does not necessarily mean that they should be able to access information.)</p>, <p><strong>Data Accuracy, Inspection, and Review</strong> Information must be accurate, and individuals should have the right to examine information about themselves and request changes. (e.g., employees should be able to review their records and make changes or follow a standard process for any information that is disputed.)</p>, <p><strong>Information Security, Integrity, and Accountability</strong> Information should be secure and not vulnerable to unauthorized modification, and the handling of the data must be subject to accountability. (e.g., it should always be known who has access to information and changes to information should be documented.)</p>, <p><strong>Education</strong> The University has the responsibility to educate its constituents concerning privacy rights and the proper handling of information. (e.g., all constituents should know whom to consult about these matters and all employees should understand their responsibilities for abiding by policies for information handling.)</p>, <p>The Data Stewards in consultation with the Office of University Counsel determine the confidentiality of the data. Data Stewards are representatives of the University who are assigned responsibility to serve as a steward of University data in a particular area. They are responsible for developing procedures for creating, maintaining, and using University data, based on University policy and applicable state and federal laws.</p>, <p>The classification Confidential Information covers sensitive information about individuals, including information identified in the Human Resources Manual, and sensitive information about the University. Information receiving this classification requires a high level of protection against unauthorized disclosure, modification, destruction, and use. Specific categories of confidential information include information about:</p>, <p><strong>Determining authorizations. </strong>Only those with legitimate, official need have the access to these classified electronic records. Data Stewards determine who is authorized to have access to their information. They should make sure that those with access have a need to know the information and know the security requirements for that information. For Confidential Information, they should also make sure that those given access have a need to know and have signed a confidentiality agreement that covers the information.</p>, <p>Georgetown University<br/>

These <strong>EIT Accessibility Procedures and Guidelines</strong> will be updated to reflect new developments, and are designed to support our community’s efforts to make EIT accessible.</p>, <p>The <strong>EIT Accessibility Procedures and Guidelines</strong> reflect a prioritized approach to making content and information accessible based on factors including the importance of content or information, how frequently it is used, the costs associated with making it fully accessible, and the availability of alternative means of providing it to individuals with disabilities upon request in a timely way.</p>, <p>For purposes of the <strong>EIT Accessibility Procedures and Guidelines</strong>, the following <strong>definitions </strong>apply:</p>, <p><em><strong>“Accessible”</strong></em> means that a person with a disability is afforded equal opportunity to obtain the same result, to gain the same benefit, or to reach the same level of achievement, in the most integrated setting appropriate to the person’s needs.</p>, <p><strong><em>“Disability”</em></strong> means a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities.</p>, <p><strong><em>“Electronic and Information Technology”</em></strong> or <strong><em>“EIT”</em></strong> includes information technology and any equipment or interconnected system or subsystem of equipment that is used in the creation, conversion or duplication of data or information. EIT includes, but is not limited to, computer hardware and software, operating systems, web based information and applications, content delivered in digital form, electronic books and materials and reading systems, search engines and databases, learning management systems, classroom technology, video and multimedia, and telephones and telecommunications products.</p>, <p><strong><em>“Legacy”</em></strong> websites or content means websites or content created before March 1, 2019.</p>, <p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>, <p>All web pages, websites and web-based software produced or procured by the University and used to conduct University-related business must meet the standards outlined in <a href="#IA">Section I.A.</a> This includes websites that use the content management system provided by University Information Services (UIS) as well as those that operate outside of the UIS content management system on different platforms.

For a list of alternatives to PDFs see <a href="https://accessibility.psu.edu/pdf/pdfissues/">Penn State Accessibility</a>.</p>, <p>Scanned PDFs are a compilation of images, therefore they are unreadable to most standard screen readers. When scanning a document to PDF, use Optical Character Recognition. OCRs specify where the text is on the page. Once a document is either converted or scanned into a PDF, the AA guidelines recommend the following basic precautions:</p>, <p>*Adobe Acrobat is widely used to create accessible PDFs. Without a PDF editor program, it may be impossible to create and edit the tags needed to adhere to AA guidelines. Alternatives to Acrobat may provide the appropriate editing features at a lower price, however they do not have accessibility tutorials.</p>, <p>Adobe Acrobat and other PDF software allow users to create fillable PDF forms.

[<p>Georgetown University is committed to fostering an inclusive academic and work environment for all individuals, including individuals with disabilities. Providing equitable and effective access to University services and information is a key component of that commitment. As such, all Electronic and Information Technology (“EIT”) used by the University must be accessible in accordance with relevant laws. Examples of EIT covered by this policy include web sites; electronic library and instructional materials, and electronic documents; video and audio; and software, hardware and systems. For the purposes of this Policy, “accessible” means a person with a disability is afforded equal opportunity to obtain the same result, to gain the same benefit, or to reach the same level of achievement, in the most integrated setting appropriate to the person’s needs. All schools, departments, business units, and University-related entities are responsible for ensuring access to their EIT in accordance with this Policy. The <a href="/eit-accessibility-procedures">University’s EIT Accessibility Procedures and Guidelines</a>, as may be amended from time to time, set forth standards and provide guidance and resources for Georgetown University community members to ensure compliance with this Policy.</p>, <p><em>Approved by the President’s Executive Committee February 4, 2019</em></p>, <p itemprop="department">Electronic and Information Technology Accessibility</p>, <p itemprop="streetAddress">3700 O Street N.W.</p>, <p>

[]
[<p>Electronic information technology, or “EIT,” is a term that encompasses a range of technologies that are used for the creation, conversion, duplication or delivery of information. The <a href="https://accessibility.georgetown.edu/eit-accessibility-policy/eit-accessibility-procedures/">Electronic and Information Technology Accessibility Procedures and Guidelines</a> address the principal forms of EIT that we use at the University (websites; electronic library and instructional materials and electronic documents; video and audio; and software and hardware systems) along with procurement practices, but “EIT” includes other technologies and can be expected to evolve as technology and the ways it is used develop.</p>, <p>According to The World Bank, 1 billion people (15% of the world’s population) experience some form of disability, with almost 57 million in the U.S. alone. At Georgetown, more than 650 students are registered with the Academic Resource Center as having disabilities, and a number of our faculty and staff also have disabilities. Many of these individuals – particularly those with visual, auditory, or motor skill disabilities – need assistive technology such as screen readers, captioned videos, or keyboard controls, in order to be able to access information online. If websites, electronic documents, audio and video and other types of information provided through technology are not provided in a way that can be accessed or “read” through assistive technology or other means, it can be difficult for people with disabilities to participate and to benefit from the University’s activities and programs. As information is increasingly moved online and accessed or delivered using technology, Georgetown’s programs and activities must be inclusive of, and accessible to, all of our faculty, staff, and students regardless of disability status. </p>, <p>The law, and the University’s existing policies, already prohibit discrimination on the basis of disability and require that we provide accommodations that enable those with disabilities to access services and information. So this <a href="https://accessibility.georgetown.edu/eit-accessibility-policy/">Policy </a>really does not change our community members’ obligations. However, as EIT has become integral to University life, understanding what “accessibility” means in various contexts (e.g., websites, e-readers, online courses, live-streamed video, etc.) has become more complex. As a result, policies that specifically address and help explain EIT accessibility and promote equal access to electronic information have become important for colleges and universities.</p>, <p>The <a href="https://accessibility.georgetown.edu/eit-accessibility-policy/eit-accessibility-procedures/">Procedures and Guidelines</a> that accompany the <a href="https://accessibility.georgetown.edu/eit-accessibility-policy/">Policy</a> are intended to set standards and provide guidance and resources to enable University community members to comply with the Policy and the law that underlies it. Standards are either required by regulatory or enforcement agencies, or are considered best practice. For example, the WCAG 2.0 AA standard for website accessibility is the standard that the Departments of Education and Justice require universities to meet in order to comply with federal law. Other guidelines and procedures (e.g. the procedure for ensuring all newly purchased software meets compliance standards) are generally accepted best practices used by colleges and universities to meet their legal and ethical obligations to provide equal access.</p>, <p>In developing these Procedures and Guidelines, we collaborated with, engaged, and benefited from the contributions of many individuals and offices that have particular expertise or will be most significantly engaged in activities affected by the Policy. The Procedures and Guidelines will be regularly reviewed and updated by the EIT Accessibility Advisory Group.</p>, <p>No. Under current University policy and federal law, faculty are already required to ensure that their course materials are made accessible for those with disabilities upon request. The new <a href="https://accessibility.georgetown.edu/eit-accessibility-policy/">Policy</a>, and the associated <a href="https://accessibility.georgetown.edu/eit-accessibility-policy/eit-accessibility-procedures/">Procedures and Guidelines</a> state that “instructional materials must be made accessible to students with disabilities upon request and in accordance with the procedures of campus disability services offices.” The new policy does not change current obligations.</p>, <p>No, it does not change existing obligations, but it may highlight existing obligations of which you are unaware. Federal enforcement agencies expect the University’s websites to be accessible by default.  Just as new public buildings must have wheelchair ramps even if nobody specifically requests one, public websites should be designed to be accessible to those who use screen readers or other assistive technology. The new <a href="https://accessibility.georgetown.edu/eit-accessibility-policy/">Policy</a> and associated <a href="https://accessibility.georgetown.edu/eit-accessibility-policy/eit-accessibility-procedures/">Procedures and Guidelines</a> merely reiterate this obligation and provide resources and information about how Georgetown faculty and staff can ensure their websites are accessible (e.g., in accordance with the WCAG 2.0AA web accessibility standards) and comply with federal law. The website standards are different than those for electronic instructional/course materials, which can be made accessible upon request (rather than by default) and in consultation with the University’s disability services offices.</p>, <p>The <a href="https://accessibility.georgetown.edu/eit-accessibility-policy/eit-accessibility-procedures/">Procedures and Guidelines</a> are designed to be pragmatic and prioritized and take into account costs and burdens and the infeasibility of making some content or materials accessible. For example, new website content (after March 1, 2019) must be accessible by default, but for legacy (older) content, departments can set up a plan to update and make that more accessible in a prioritized manner (e.g., prioritizing public facing or heavily trafficked content). Similarly, all new video content that is made publicly available needs to be accessible (i.e., captioned) by default, but content that is behind a firewall and requires GUID to access only needs to be made accessible upon request. These and other distinctions recognize the goal of making as much content as possible accessible and the reality that fixing websites, transcribing thousands of videos, and taking other steps would be extremely costly and in some instances not feasible.</p>, <p>No. The <a href="https://accessibility.georgetown.edu/eit-accessibility-policy/">Policy</a> requires compliance with federal and local disability laws. Laws like the ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation act require that websites be made accessible or that reasonable accommodations be made unless doing so would change the fundamental nature of the program or cause an undue financial or administrative burden. If no technology reasonably exists that can make your materials or your software accessible, then the law – and University policy – do not require you do to so. However, in the classroom/instruction context, if there are other ways that the information can be reasonably conveyed to a student (such as having a written or spoken description of a complex chart), the law – and University policy – would require you to provide that reasonable alternative. </p>, <p>With respect to procurement, the University realizes that in some limited circumstances, it may be necessary to procure software, hardware, and other products may not be fully compliant with accessibility standards. The procurement process has an exception policy through which a department can explain why the product is necessary, why it cannot be made accessible, whether it will be made accessible in the future, and how the individual/department procuring the product will provide an alternate solution in the event an individual with a disability is unable to use the product.</p>, <p>The EIT Accessibility Advisory Group will meet periodically to review and update the “<a href="https://accessibility.georgetown.edu/eit-accessibility-policy/eit-accessibility-procedures/">Procedures and Guidelines</a>” to reflect changing accessibility standards and technology without needing to make changes to the <a href="https://accessibility.georgetown.edu/eit-accessibility-policy/">Policy</a> itself.</p>, <p>The University has created <a href="https://accessibility.georgetown.edu/">this website</a> to include a wealth of resources and information to help Georgetown community members understand accessibility. UIS also offers <a href="https://accessibility.georgetown.edu/training/">web accessibility training</a> for community members, and the Web Services team is always available to talk through concerns or questions and assist. </p>, <p itemprop="department">Electronic and Information Technology Accessibility</p>, <p itemprop="streetAddress">3700 O Street N.W.</p>, <p>

For a list of alternatives to PDFs see <a href="https://accessibility.psu.edu/pdf/pdfissues/">Penn State Accessibility</a>.</p>, <p>Scanned PDFs are a compilation of images, therefore they are unreadable to most standard screen readers. When scanning a document to PDF, use Optical Character Recognition. OCRs specify where the text is on the page. Once a document is either converted or scanned into a PDF, the AA guidelines recommend the following basic precautions:</p>, <p>*Adobe Acrobat is widely used to create accessible PDFs. Without a PDF editor program, it may be impossible to create and edit the tags needed to adhere to AA guidelines. Alternatives to Acrobat may provide the appropriate editing features at a lower price, however they do not have accessibility tutorials.</p>, <p>Adobe Acrobat and other PDF software allow users to create fillable PDF forms.

[<p>Georgetown University is committed to fostering an inclusive academic and work environment for all individuals, including individuals with disabilities. Providing equitable and effective access to University services and information is a key component of that commitment. As such, all Electronic and Information Technology (“EIT”) used by the University must be accessible in accordance with relevant laws. Examples of EIT covered by this policy include web sites; electronic library and instructional materials, and electronic documents; video and audio; and software, hardware and systems. For the purposes of this Policy, “accessible” means a person with a disability is afforded equal opportunity to obtain the same result, to gain the same benefit, or to reach the same level of achievement, in the most integrated setting appropriate to the person’s needs. All schools, departments, business units, and University-related entities are responsible for ensuring access to their EIT in accordance with this Policy. The <a href="/eit-accessibility-procedures">University’s EIT Accessibility Procedures and Guidelines</a>, as may be amended from time to time, set forth standards and provide guidance and resources for Georgetown University community members to ensure compliance with this Policy.</p>, <p><em>Approved by the President’s Executive Committee February 4, 2019</em></p>, <p itemprop="department">Electronic and Information Technology Accessibility</p>, <p itemprop="streetAddress">3700 O Street N.W.</p>, <p>

It also includes software that is freeware, shareware, desktop, enterprise, subscription, and cloud or remotely-hosted. To allow individuals with disabilities to participate fully in the learning, scholarship, service, and other work of the University, it is vital that the software, hardware, and systems the University uses be compatible with assistive technologies used by those with disabilities.</p>, <p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>, <p>Responsibility for ensuring that EIT used at the University is accessible for those with disabilities falls not only on the University, but also on the vendors from which the University purchases EIT.</p>, <p>It is important that those who purchase EIT for the University or using University funds, ensure this by 1) discussing accessibility requirements with vendors; 2) verifying vendor information; and 3) including appropriate language in purchase orders and contracts.</p>, <p>The University recognizes that in certain limited circumstances, full conformance with accessibility standards may not be feasible, e.g., due to the nature or purpose of the EIT, the lack of accessible solutions available on the market, or unreasonably burdensome administrative or financial cost necessary to make the resource(s) accessible. In such circumstances, the University may permit exceptions to these Accessibility Procedures and Guidelines for EIT Procurement. Such exceptions must be appropriately justified and approved by both the head of the relevant school, department or business unit (at the Dean or Vice President level), as well as the CIO or the CIO’s designee.

[<p>Electronic information technology, or “EIT,” is a term that encompasses a range of technologies that are used for the creation, conversion, duplication or delivery of information. The <a href="https://accessibility.georgetown.edu/eit-accessibility-policy/eit-accessibility-procedures/">Electronic and Information Technology Accessibility Procedures and Guidelines</a> address the principal forms of EIT that we use at the University (websites; electronic library and instructional materials and electronic documents; video and audio; and software and hardware systems) along with procurement practices, but “EIT” includes other technologies and can be expected to evolve as technology and the ways it is used develop.</p>, <p>According to The World Bank, 1 billion people (15% of the world’s population) experience some form of disability, with almost 57 million in the U.S. alone. At Georgetown, more than 650 students are registered with the Academic Resource Center as having disabilities, and a number of our faculty and staff also have disabilities. Many of these individuals – particularly those with visual, auditory, or motor skill disabilities – need assistive technology such as screen readers, captioned videos, or keyboard controls, in order to be able to access information online. If websites, electronic documents, audio and video and other types of information provided through technology are not provided in a way that can be accessed or “read” through assistive technology or other means, it can be difficult for people with disabilities to participate and to benefit from the University’s activities and programs. As information is increasingly moved online and accessed or delivered using technology, Georgetown’s programs and activities must be inclusive of, and accessible to, all of our faculty, staff, and students regardless of disability status. </p>, <p>The law, and the University’s existing policies, already prohibit discrimination on the basis of disability and require that we provide accommodations that enable those with disabilities to access services and information. So this <a href="https://accessibility.georgetown.edu/eit-accessibility-policy/">Policy </a>really does not change our community members’ obligations. However, as EIT has become integral to University life, understanding what “accessibility” means in various contexts (e.g., websites, e-readers, online courses, live-streamed video, etc.) has become more complex. As a result, policies that specifically address and help explain EIT accessibility and promote equal access to electronic information have become important for colleges and universities.</p>, <p>The <a href="https://accessibility.georgetown.edu/eit-accessibility-policy/eit-accessibility-procedures/">Procedures and Guidelines</a> that accompany the <a href="https://accessibility.georgetown.edu/eit-accessibility-policy/">Policy</a> are intended to set standards and provide guidance and resources to enable University community members to comply with the Policy and the law that underlies it. Standards are either required by regulatory or enforcement agencies, or are considered best practice. For example, the WCAG 2.0 AA standard for website accessibility is the standard that the Departments of Education and Justice require universities to meet in order to comply with federal law. Other guidelines and procedures (e.g. the procedure for ensuring all newly purchased software meets compliance standards) are generally accepted best practices used by colleges and universities to meet their legal and ethical obligations to provide equal access.</p>, <p>In developing these Procedures and Guidelines, we collaborated with, engaged, and benefited from the contributions of many individuals and offices that have particular expertise or will be most significantly engaged in activities affected by the Policy. The Procedures and Guidelines will be regularly reviewed and updated by the EIT Accessibility Advisory Group.</p>, <p>No. Under current University policy and federal law, faculty are already required to ensure that their course materials are made accessible for those with disabilities upon request. The new <a href="https://accessibility.georgetown.edu/eit-accessibility-policy/">Policy</a>, and the associated <a href="https://accessibility.georgetown.edu/eit-accessibility-policy/eit-accessibility-procedures/">Procedures and Guidelines</a> state that “instructional materials must be made accessible to students with disabilities upon request and in accordance with the procedures of campus disability services offices.” The new policy does not change current obligations.</p>, <p>No, it does not change existing obligations, but it may highlight existing obligations of which you are unaware. Federal enforcement agencies expect the University’s websites to be accessible by default.  Just as new public buildings must have wheelchair ramps even if nobody specifically requests one, public websites should be designed to be accessible to those who use screen readers or other assistive technology. The new <a href="https://accessibility.georgetown.edu/eit-accessibility-policy/">Policy</a> and associated <a href="https://accessibility.georgetown.edu/eit-accessibility-policy/eit-accessibility-procedures/">Procedures and Guidelines</a> merely reiterate this obligation and provide resources and information about how Georgetown faculty and staff can ensure their websites are accessible (e.g., in accordance with the WCAG 2.0AA web accessibility standards) and comply with federal law. The website standards are different than those for electronic instructional/course materials, which can be made accessible upon request (rather than by default) and in consultation with the University’s disability services offices.</p>, <p>The <a href="https://accessibility.georgetown.edu/eit-accessibility-policy/eit-accessibility-procedures/">Procedures and Guidelines</a> are designed to be pragmatic and prioritized and take into account costs and burdens and the infeasibility of making some content or materials accessible. For example, new website content (after March 1, 2019) must be accessible by default, but for legacy (older) content, departments can set up a plan to update and make that more accessible in a prioritized manner (e.g., prioritizing public facing or heavily trafficked content). Similarly, all new video content that is made publicly available needs to be accessible (i.e., captioned) by default, but content that is behind a firewall and requires GUID to access only needs to be made accessible upon request. These and other distinctions recognize the goal of making as much content as possible accessible and the reality that fixing websites, transcribing thousands of videos, and taking other steps would be extremely costly and in some instances not feasible.</p>, <p>No. The <a href="https://accessibility.georgetown.edu/eit-accessibility-policy/">Policy</a> requires compliance with federal and local disability laws. Laws like the ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation act require that websites be made accessible or that reasonable accommodations be made unless doing so would change the fundamental nature of the program or cause an undue financial or administrative burden. If no technology reasonably exists that can make your materials or your software accessible, then the law – and University policy – do not require you do to so. However, in the classroom/instruction context, if there are other ways that the information can be reasonably conveyed to a student (such as having a written or spoken description of a complex chart), the law – and University policy – would require you to provide that reasonable alternative. </p>, <p>With respect to procurement, the University realizes that in some limited circumstances, it may be necessary to procure software, hardware, and other products may not be fully compliant with accessibility standards. The procurement process has an exception policy through which a department can explain why the product is necessary, why it cannot be made accessible, whether it will be made accessible in the future, and how the individual/department procuring the product will provide an alternate solution in the event an individual with a disability is unable to use the product.</p>, <p>The EIT Accessibility Advisory Group will meet periodically to review and update the “<a href="https://accessibility.georgetown.edu/eit-accessibility-policy/eit-accessibility-procedures/">Procedures and Guidelines</a>” to reflect changing accessibility standards and technology without needing to make changes to the <a href="https://accessibility.georgetown.edu/eit-accessibility-policy/">Policy</a> itself.</p>, <p>The University has created <a href="https://accessibility.georgetown.edu/">this website</a> to include a wealth of resources and information to help Georgetown community members understand accessibility. UIS also offers <a href="https://accessibility.georgetown.edu/training/">web accessibility training</a> for community members, and the Web Services team is always available to talk through concerns or questions and assist. </p>, <p itemprop="department">Electronic and Information Technology Accessibility</p>, <p itemprop="streetAddress">3700 O Street N.W.</p>, <p>

    Access by everyone regardless of disability is an essential aspect.</p>, <p>The Web is fundamentally designed to work for all people, whatever their hardware, software, language, location, or ability. When the Web meets this goal, it is accessible to people with a diverse range of hearing, movement, sight, and cognitive ability.</p>, <p>Thus the impact of disability is radically changed on the Web because the Web removes barriers to communication and interaction that many people face in the physical world. However, when websites, applications, technologies, or tools are badly designed, they can create barriers that exclude people from using the Web.</p>, <p><strong>Accessibility is essential for developers and organizations that want to create high-quality websites and web tools, and not exclude people from using their products and services.</strong></p>, <p>Web accessibility means that websites, tools, and technologies are designed and developed so that people with disabilities can use them.

</a></p>, <p>The Web is an increasingly important resource in many aspects of life: education, employment, government, commerce, health care, recreation, and more. It is essential that the Web be accessible in order to provide equal access and equal opportunity to people with diverse abilities. Access to information and communications technologies, including the Web, is defined as a basic human right in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN <a href="https://www.un.org/development/desa/disabilities/convention-on-the-rights-of-persons-with-disabilities.html">CRPD</a>).</p>, <p>The Web offers the possibility of unprecedented access to information and interaction for many people with disabilities. That is, the accessibility barriers to print, audio, and visual media can be much more easily overcome through web technologies.</p>, <p>Accessibility supports social inclusion for people with disabilities as well as others, such as:</p>, <p><strong>There is also a strong business case for accessibility.</strong> As shown in the previous section, accessible design improves overall user experience and satisfaction, especially in a variety of situations, across different devices, and for older users. Accessibility can enhance your brand, drive innovation, and extend your market reach.</p>, <p>Web accessibility is <strong>required by law</strong> in many situations.</p>, <p>Web accessibility depends on several components working together, including web technologies, web browsers and other "user agents", authoring tools, and websites.</p>, <p>The W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (<a href="/WAI/get-involved/">WAI</a>) develops technical specifications, guidelines, techniques, and supporting resources that describe accessibility solutions. These are considered international standards for web accessibility; for example, <abbr title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)">WCAG</abbr> 2.0 is also an <abbr title="International Organization for Standardization">ISO</abbr> standard: ISO/<abbr title="International Electrotechnical Commission">IEC</abbr> 40500.</p>, <p>Many aspects of accessibility are fairly easy to understand and implement. Some accessibility solutions are more complex and take more knowledge to implement.</p>, <p>It is most efficient and effective to incorporate accessibility from the very beginning of projects, so you don’t need go back and to re-do work.</p>, <p>When developing or redesigning a website, evaluate accessibility early and throughout the development process to identify accessibility problems early, when it is easier to address them. Simple steps, such as changing settings in a browser, can help you evaluate some aspects of accessibility. Comprehensive evaluation to determine if a website meets all accessibility guidelines takes more effort.</p>, <p>There are evaluation tools that help with evaluation. However, no tool alone can determine if a site meets accessibility guidelines. Knowledgeable human evaluation is required to determine if a site is accessible.</p>, <p><img alt="image of logo; HTML markup img alt='Web Accessibility Initiative logo'" class="right" src="https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/alt-logo.png"/></p>, <p>Images should include <em><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/text-equiv.html">equivalent alternative text</a></em> (alt text) in the markup/code.</p>, <p>If alt text isn’t provided for images, the image information is inaccessible, for example, to people who cannot see and use a screen reader that reads aloud the information on a page, including the alt text for the visual image.</p>, <p>When equivalent alt text is provided, the information is available to people who are blind, as well as to people who turn off images (for example, in areas with expensive or low bandwidth). It’s also available to technologies that cannot see images, such as search engines.</p>, <p><img alt="mouse crossed out" class="left" height="45" src="https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/no-mouse.png" width="67"/></p>, <p>Some people cannot use a mouse, including many older users with limited fine motor control. An accessible website does not rely on the mouse; it makes <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/keyboard-operation.html">all functionality available from a keyboard</a>. Then people with disabilities can use <a href="/WAI/planning/involving-users/#at">assistive technologies</a> that mimic the keyboard, such as speech input.</p>, <p><a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/highlights/200606wcag2interview.html"><img alt="example transcript" class="right" height="254" src="https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/transcript.png" width="251"/></a></p>, <p>Just as images aren’t available to people who can’t see, audio files aren’t available to people who can’t hear. Providing a text transcript makes the audio information accessible to people who are deaf or hard of hearing, as well as to search engines and other technologies that can’t hear.</p>, <p>It’s easy and relatively inexpensive for websites to provide transcripts. There are also <a href="http://www.uiaccess.com/transcripts/transcript_services.html">transcription services</a> that create text transcripts in HTML format.</p>, <p>W3C WAI provides a wide range of resources on different aspects of web accessibility <a href="/WAI/standards-guidelines/">standards</a>, <a href="/WAI/teach-advocate/">education</a>, <a href="/WAI/test-evaluate/">testing/evaluation</a>, <a href="/WAI/planning/">project management, and policy</a>.

[<p>In keeping with state and federal legislation, the University safeguards the privacy of patients, students, employees, University business, and other matters by protecting electronic records classified as confidential information. Unauthorized accessing and/or disclosure of confidential information by University employees is prohibited and may result in legal penalties. This policy applies to records maintained in any type of electronic record: computer, voice, or video. It also applies to records created via the Georgetown University website.</p>, <p><strong>Electronic Records:</strong> Electronic transmissions or messages created, sent, forwarded, replied to, transmitted, distributed, broadcast, stored, held, copied, downloaded, displayed, viewed, read, or printed by one or several electronic systems or services. This definition of electronic records applies equally to the contents of such records, attachments to such records, and transactional information associated with such records.</p>, <p><strong>University Administrative Record:</strong> A University Record (see definition below) that is directly related to the conduct of the University’s administrative business.</p>, <p><strong>University Record:</strong> By law, University records are any papers, books, photographs, tapes, films, recordings, or other documentary materials, or any copies thereof, regardless of physical form or characteristics, made, produced, executed, or received by any department or office of the University or by any academic or administrative staff member in connection with the transaction of University business, and retained by that agency or its successor as evidence of its activities or functions because of the information contained therein.</p>, <p><strong>University Electronic Record:</strong> A University Record in the form of an electronic record, whether or not any of the electronic communications resources utilized to create, send, forward, reply to, transmit, store, hold, copy, download, display, view, read, or print the electronic communications record are owned by the University. This implies that the location of the record, or the location of its creation or use, does not change its nature as a University electronic record for purposes of this or other University policy.</p>, <p>Until determined otherwise or unless it is clear from the context, any electronic record residing on university-owned or controlled telecommunications, video, audio, and computing facilities will be deemed to be a University electronic record for purposes of this Policy.</p>, <p><strong>Notification</strong> Users should be notified that information is being collected and they should be informed of their rights. (e.g., all Web pages that collect personally identifiable information should include a privacy notice that specifies how the information will be used.)</p>, <p><strong>Minimization</strong> The institution should gather as little information as possible for legitimate purposes and delete information when it is no longer needed or no longer required by law to be retained. (e.g., library records need not be kept for more than a certain limited period of time.)</p>, <p><strong>Secondary</strong> Use Information should be used only for the purposes for which it was collected unless the individual gives additional consent. (e.g., a department should not share information with an administrative office for a separate purpose without the individual’s knowledge and consent.)</p>, <p><strong>Nondisclosure and Consent</strong> Information should not be released to third parties external to the University without consent. (e.g., vendors, business, etc.)</p>, <p><strong>Need to Know</strong> Only those with legitimate, official needs should have access to information. (e.g., a person’s position of authority in the University does not necessarily mean that they should be able to access information.)</p>, <p><strong>Data Accuracy, Inspection, and Review</strong> Information must be accurate, and individuals should have the right to examine information about themselves and request changes. (e.g., employees should be able to review their records and make changes or follow a standard process for any information that is disputed.)</p>, <p><strong>Information Security, Integrity, and Accountability</strong> Information should be secure and not vulnerable to unauthorized modification, and the handling of the data must be subject to accountability. (e.g., it should always be known who has access to information and changes to information should be documented.)</p>, <p><strong>Education</strong> The University has the responsibility to educate its constituents concerning privacy rights and the proper handling of information. (e.g., all constituents should know whom to consult about these matters and all employees should understand their responsibilities for abiding by policies for information handling.)</p>, <p>The Data Stewards in consultation with the Office of University Counsel determine the confidentiality of the data. Data Stewards are representatives of the University who are assigned responsibility to serve as a steward of University data in a particular area. They are responsible for developing procedures for creating, maintaining, and using University data, based on University policy and applicable state and federal laws.</p>, <p>The classification Confidential Information covers sensitive information about individuals, including information identified in the Human Resources Manual, and sensitive information about the University. Information receiving this classification requires a high level of protection against unauthorized disclosure, modification, destruction, and use. Specific categories of confidential information include information about:</p>, <p><strong>Determining authorizations. </strong>Only those with legitimate, official need have the access to these classified electronic records. Data Stewards determine who is authorized to have access to their information. They should make sure that those with access have a need to know the information and know the security requirements for that information.
